                  </span>
                  It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered
                  in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.

                <p class="content-detail">
                  Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever,
                  cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more
                  severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute
                  respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.

                <p class="content-detail">
                  Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include
                  regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing
                  and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close
                  contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness
                  such as coughing and sneezing.

                              who were in quarantine.

                            <p>
                              Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable
                              group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is
                              associated with a lack of knowledge about how
                              COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears
                              about disease and death, and gossip that spreads
                              rumors and myths.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or
                              anger towards ordinary people instead of the
                              disease that is causing the problem.

                              Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some
                              cause illness in people, and others, such as
                              canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect
                              animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect
                              animals have emerged to infect people and can
                              spread between people. This is suspected to have
                              occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19.
                              Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
                              Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other
                              examples of coronaviruses that originated from
                              animals and then spread to people. More

                              Province, China. The first infections were linked
                              to a live animal market, but the virus is now
                              spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to
                              note that person-to-person spread can happen on a
                              continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious
                              (like measles), while other viruses are less so.

                              The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from
                              person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick
                              with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others.
                              That is why CDC recommends that these patients be
                              isolated either in the hospital or at home
                              (depending on how sick they are) until they are

                              by providing social support. Counter stigma by
                              learning and sharing facts. Communicating the
                              facts that viruses do not target specific racial
                              or ethnic groups and how COVID-19 actually spreads
                              can help stop stigma.

                              People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about
                              friends and relatives who are living in or
                              visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some
                              people are worried about the disease. Fear and
                              anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example,
                              towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people
                              who were in quarantine.

                              Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable
                              group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is
                              associated with a lack of knowledge about how
                              COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears
                              about disease and death, and gossip that spreads
                              rumors and myths.

                              Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some
                              cause illness in people, and others, such as
                              canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect
                              animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect
                              animals have emerged to infect people and can
                              spread between people. This is suspected to have
                              occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19.
                              Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
                              Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other
                              examples of coronaviruses that originated from
                              animals and then spread to people. More

                              This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei
                              Province, China. The first infections were linked
                              to a live animal market, but the virus is now
                              spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to
                              note that person-to-person spread can happen on a
                              continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious
                              (like measles), while other viruses are less so.

                              The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from
                              person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick
                              with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others.
                              That is why CDC recommends that these patients be
                              isolated either in the hospital or at home
                              (depending on how sick they are) until they are

                              Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019
                              novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.

                              There are many types of human coronaviruses
                              including some that commonly cause mild
                              upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a

                              humans. The name of this disease was selected
                              following the World Health Organization (WHO) best

                              People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about

                              people are worried about the disease. Fear and
                              anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example,
                              towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people

                              associated with a lack of knowledge about how
                              COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears
                              about disease and death, and gossip that spreads

                              Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some
                              cause illness in people, and others, such as
                              canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect
                              animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect
                              animals have emerged to infect people and can
                              spread between people. This is suspected to have
                              occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19.
                              Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
                              Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other
                              examples of coronaviruses that originated from
                              animals and then spread to people. More

                              This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei
                              Province, China. The first infections were linked
                              to a live animal market, but the virus is now
                              spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to
                              note that person-to-person spread can happen on a
                              continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious
                              (like measles), while other viruses are less so.

                              The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from
                              person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick
                              with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others.
                              That is why CDC recommends that these patients be
                              isolated either in the hospital or at home
                              (depending on how sick they are) until they are
